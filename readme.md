#Snowflakes

for this holiday season we give you a simple way to annoy your website visitors and waste their CPU cycles - Yes you've guessed it snowflakes on a webpage.

Now we know, this used to be done the old fasion way in the 90ies, but now we have canvas and pointer-events:none, so the pesky things won't interfear with anything else on the page.

Say thank you to @mrserge for asking me if I can code this useless thing.

Oh, usage: 

add a script tag pointing to snowflakes.js, and then in your domready function call window.snowflakes();
